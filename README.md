synthesis
=========

An Efficient, Versatile C++ Templating Framework, written by [Alvaro J. Genial](http://alva.ro).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ajg/synthesis.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ajg/synthesis)

Synopsis
--------

Synthesis is a template frameworkâ€”a set of components that can be mixed and matched to build the right functionality; furthermore, components are loosely-coupled, designed to be both extensible and replaceable.

Status
------

The `synthesis` codebase is mature and well-tested; the bindings are still a work in progress.

Motivation
----------

Synthesis blurs the line between compile-time and runtime, and it does so by blending three worlds: (a) the static C++ type system; (b) the dynamic values that need to be manipulated and formatted; and (c) the templates to do so. The name is an allusion to this process.
